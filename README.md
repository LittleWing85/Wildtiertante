My app supports private foster homes and rescue centers in raising baby wild mammals. It offers a tool which helps to organize the milk feedings of orphaned mammals. I've just started this project - so what you see is only the beginning of it.

I have volunteered with wildlife at shelters for 10 years. I also raise particularly sensitive squirrels, rabbits and mice in my home.

The next topics I tackle for my website are:

-   Updating of the code
-   Set up SSL certificate
-   Optimize responsiveness
-   Implementation of further functions like:
    -   Possibility to edit the data for litters and individual litter members
    -   Automatic display of the optimal amount of milk per feeding (calculation based on weight and age)
    -   Automatic alerts for forgotten feedings, animal weight loss or approaching the maximum milk amount for a day too quickly

... And similar features that make rearing easier for foster parents!
