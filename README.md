# Wildtiertante

This is the code for my project you can find at www.wildtiertante.de. I have just started this project - so what you see is just the beginning of it.
"Windtiertante" is a tool which I develop to help wildlife stations, animal shelters and private breeding centers to organize the milk feedings of orphaned mammals.
I have volunteered with wildlife at shelters for 9 years. I also raise particularly sensitive squirrels, rabbits and mice from the shelter in my home.
It really is wonderful volunteering :-)


The next topics I tackle for my website are:

- Forwarding from wildtierante.de to my website
- Set up SSL certificate
- Optimize responsiveness
- Implementation of further functions like:
  - Possibility to edit the data for litters and individual litter members
  - Automatic display of the optimal amount of milk per feeding (calculation based on weight and age)
  - Automatic alerts for forgotten feedings, animal weight loss or approaching the maximum milk amount for a day too quickly

... And similar features that make rearing easier for foster parents!
