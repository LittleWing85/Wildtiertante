# Wildtiertante

To see the code working, run npm run dev.

And visit https://localhost:4000/

My app supports private foster homes and rescue centers in raising baby wild mammals. It offers a tool which helps to organize the milk feedings of orphaned mammals. I've just started this project - so what you see is only the beginning of it.

I have volunteered with wildlife at shelters for 10 years. I also raise particularly sensitive squirrels, rabbits and mice in my home.

The next topics I tackle for my website are:

- Updating of the code
- Set up SSL certificate
- Optimize responsiveness
- Implementation of further functions like:
    - Possibility to edit the data for litters and individual litter members
    - Automatic display of the optimal amount of milk per feeding (calculation based on weight and age)
    - Automatic alerts for forgotten feedings, animal weight loss or approaching the maximum milk amount for a day too quickly

... And similar features that make rearing easier for foster parents!
